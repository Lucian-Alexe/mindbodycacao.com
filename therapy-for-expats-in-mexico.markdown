                <h1 class="text-center mt-3 mb-5">Expats Living in Mexico</h1> 
                <p class="page-intro">Moving to Mexico City is exciting, but it can also feel overwhelming at times. Whether you came here for work, to be with family, or just for a change of scenery, starting fresh in a new place can be harder than it seems.</p>
                <p class="page-intro"><strong>I get it</strong>. I’ve lived in the US, Europe, and now Mexico, so I know how it feels to adjust to a new culture and build a life from scratch. Missing your friends, feeling like a stranger in a new city, struggling with language barriers... these are things that really hit home. Or it might be that your family is taking longer to adapt. All these are real challenges.</p>
                <p class="page-intro">That’s why I offer therapy in both <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Spanish</strong> in Mexico City. I want you to feel completely supported, no matter where you’re from. My goal is to help you feel more at home here, work through the ups and downs of living abroad, and find peace in this exciting new chapter of your life.</p>
                <p class="page-intro">Prices are fully transparent, with the cost of a therapy session at MX$1000.</p>

                        <h2 class="">Why therapy might be helpful for you</h2>
                        <p>Living in a new country can be thrilling, but it can also bring up some tough emotions. You might be feeling:</p>
                        <ul class="page-service-list">
                            <li><strong>Culture shock</strong>: it’s normal to feel disoriented as you adjust to a new way of life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loneliness</strong>: missing your old friends or the familiar things that made you feel at home.</li>
                            <li><strong>Struggling to build a new community</strong> or find a place where you truly belong.</li>
                            <li><strong>Changes in your identity</strong> as you adapt to a new culture and environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Homesickness</strong>: it’s hard to be far from the people and places you love.</li>
                            <li><strong>The stress of dealing with language barriers</strong> or not fully understanding the local customs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relationship strain</strong>: whether with your partner or family, living abroad can put pressure on your connections.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety</strong> related to the uncertainty and instability of life abroad.</li>

            <h2>Recommended therapeutic approaches:</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>Below is an overview of the therapeutic approaches used in sessions. Your treatment plan is always personalized, these modalities can be used individually or combined depending on your needs - including with the body movement therapy or other therapies.</p>
                    <div class="page-services-explanation">

                                <h3>Traditional Psychotherapy</h3> <p> This is a chance for you to open up about what’s been weighing on you... whether it’s adjusting to life in Mexico, missing home, or just feeling uncertain. We’ll talk through your feelings, explore how you’re coping, and work together to build resilience. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>EMDR</h3>
                                <p>If the stress of moving or life changes is overwhelming, EMDR can help you process those emotions. It’s especially helpful when you’re feeling stuck or trapped by your experiences.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Brainspotting Therapy</h3>
                                <p>This approach goes deep into the emotional side of things, helping you connect with feelings of being out of place or unsure of your sense of belonging here.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Body Movement & Somatic Work</h3>
                                <p>When you’re adjusting to a new life, your body can feel “on edge.” Through breathing exercises, gentle movement, and yoga-based practices, we’ll help calm your body and ease the tension that comes with living abroad.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Optional Cacao Session</h3>
                                <p>If you’re going through a big transition or struggling to find your balance, a cacao ceremony can offer a gentle, grounding ritual. It’s a way to open your heart and help you process emotions in a calming, spiritual way.</p>

                                <h3>Traditional Psychotherapy</h3> <p> Talk therapy provides a supportive space to process the emotional complexity of building a life abroad. We explore identity changes, cultural adjustment, loneliness, and the stress of transition. This approach helps you make sense of your experience while strengthening resilience and belonging. </p>
                            </li>

                                <h3>EMDR</h3>
                                <p>Helps process emotional overwhelm from sudden relocation, major life changes, or identity confusion.</p>

                                <p>Supports the deeper emotional experience of feeling rootless or unsure of belonging.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Relocation often keeps the body in “alert mode.” We use grounding movement, breathwork, and yoga-based practices to help the body settle so the mind can, too.</p>
                            </li>

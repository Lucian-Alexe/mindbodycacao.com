                <h1 class="text-center mt-3 mb-5">Body Therapy (Yoga, Dance, Movement)</h1> 
                <p class="page-intro">Body-based therapy supports emotional healing by reconnecting you with the wisdom and signals of your physical self. This work is especially helpful when talking alone doesn’t quite touch the deeper layers of stress, pain, or emotion. Because the body holds memory, tension, and unprocessed experiences, movement can bring clarity and release in a way that words sometimes cannot.</p>
                <p>My background as a yoga instructor and trained dancer shapes the way I guide this process. Sessions may include gentle yoga therapy to help regulate the nervous system, movement therapy to explore emotions through the body, or embodiment practices that build a stronger sense of inner safety and presence. Dance therapy invites creative expression and helps clients reconnect with vitality, while elements of somatic experiencing support healing from stress or trauma by helping the body complete patterns it never had space to finish.</p>
                <p>People often come to body therapy when they feel disconnected from themselves, when emotions feel “stuck,” or when stress shows up physically as tension, fatigue, tightness, or restlessness. This approach is especially supportive for clients who want to feel more grounded, more in tune with their emotions, and more at home in their bodies. It is available online or in-person in Mexico City.</p>

                                <p>Yoga therapy blends mindful movement, breathwork, and grounding practices to help regulate your nervous system and create a sense of safety and steadiness inside your body.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> It’s especially supportive for reducing anxiety, easing physical tension, improving sleep, and reconnecting with parts of yourself that feel shut down.</p>

                                <p>Movement therapy invites you to explore your emotional world through gentle, intuitive motion. You don’t need any experience, just the curiosity to explore.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> This approach helps loosen patterns held in the body, release stored stress, and tap into more freedom, energy, and self-expression.</p>

                                <p>Embodiment practices focus on tuning into what you feel, where you feel it, and what your body is trying to communicate.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> Many clients find that embodiment helps them navigate anxiety, boundaries, self-trust, and relationships because it brings them back to an inner sense of clarity and truth.</p>

                                <h3>EMDR</h3>
                                <p>Helps reprocess painful or intrusive memories—for example, revisiting a moment that still causes anxiety and transforming its emotional impact.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Brainspotting Therapy</h3>
                                <p>Uses eye position and focused awareness to access deeper emotional layers, such as unexplained tension that surfaces in stressful situations.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Body Movement & Somatic Work</h3>
                                <p>Because the body stores anxiety (tight chest, clenched jaw, shallow breathing), we use yoga-based stretching, breathwork, and grounding exercises to help the body relax so the mind can think more clearly. Always combined with talk therapy.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>A mindful cacao ritual that encourages emotional openness and grounding, helping you connect with intuition and soften emotional barriers.</p>

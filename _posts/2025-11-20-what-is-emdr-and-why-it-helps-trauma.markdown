<div class="intro-blog">When someone first asks me about EMDR, I often start with a simple image: imagine a drawer in your mind where a painful memory is still stuck, half-closed, spilling out into your everyday life. EMDR helps the mind finally tuck that memory away so it no longer overwhelms you. In my 15+ years of working with clients across the United States and Mexico, I’ve seen EMDR gently but profoundly shift how people experience their past.</div>

## What EMDR Actually Is

EMDR stands for *Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing*. It’s an evidence-based therapy that helps the brain reprocess distressing memories so they stop feeling so raw or threatening.

Instead of talking through every detail of a painful experience, EMDR uses bilateral stimulation—usually guided eye movements, gentle tapping, or alternating sounds—while you focus on a memory or emotion. This activates the brain’s natural ability to move toward healing, clarity, and emotional balance.

## How It Feels and How It Works

Most people don’t experience dramatic “lightbulb moments.” Instead, the healing often shows up as small, meaningful changes:

- A memory that used to overwhelm you suddenly feels more distant  
- The anxiety in your chest eases  
- A trigger that used to send you spiraling loses its power  

These shifts happen because EMDR helps the brain store the memory in a healthier, more integrated way. You still remember what happened, but it no longer feels like it’s happening *to you* in the present.

## Who EMDR Helps

EMDR is one of the most effective therapies we have for trauma and PTSD, but it’s also incredibly supportive for:

- Childhood emotional wounds  
- Anxiety and panic  
- Relationship trauma or painful breakups  
- Accidents, surgeries, and medical trauma  
- Grief and loss  
- Emotional triggers that feel “out of proportion”  
- Persistent patterns that don’t change, even with talk therapy  

It’s especially helpful for people who feel stuck or who sense their body still reacts strongly to memories they thought they had “moved past.”

## A Note on Safety and Process

EMDR is not about reliving trauma, and it isn’t done abruptly. We first prepare your nervous system, build internal resources, and make sure you feel grounded. The pace is gentle, collaborative, and always centered on your sense of safety.

## A Quote I Come Back To

> “At this point, there is enough research for me to believe that both are true. So, if I had to do it over again, I’d simply call it ‘Reprocessing Therapy.’”  
> — *Francine Shapiro, founder of EMDR*

## My Experience Using EMDR

Because my background includes psychotherapy, yoga, somatic work, and dance, I pay close attention to how emotions live in the body. When I use EMDR, I often weave in grounding, breathwork, and gentle body awareness. This helps clients feel safe, steady, and supported as they reprocess painful moments.

Over the years, EMDR has consistently been one of the most transformative tools I use. It helps people release what they’ve been carrying for far too long and move forward feeling lighter, clearer, and more grounded in themselves.

If you’re curious about EMDR or wondering whether it might support your healing process, I offer consultations where we can explore whether it’s the right fit for you.

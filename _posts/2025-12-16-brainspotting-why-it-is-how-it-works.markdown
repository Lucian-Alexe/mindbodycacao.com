<div class="intro-blog">Perhaps you are searching for a new way to do therapy and came across a method called Brainspotting. But what is this, and why is it getting everyone’s attention in the field of mental health? Well, let’s take a look and find out why Brainspotting is truly effective, and how its valid principles and theories are summed up in the following sections.</div>


## What is Brainspotting?

**Brainspotting**:  
"Brainspotting" is a therapy modality that was born from the brain of Dr. David Grand in 2003. It's essentially about locating a point in your field of vision that relates to emotions or memories that may be holding you back. It sounds kind of wonky, but this is what makes it so awesome: when you’re experiencing trauma or emotional issues, they’re stored in your brain in such a way that can’t be accessed through traditional talk therapies.

Brainspotting assists in this regard in finding a spot in your eyes that is somehow related to these emotions, which in turn can help in releasing them. Rather than searching your memories in a direct manner to access painful events of your past, this approach gives you a chance to tap into your brain in a manner that is not directly reached.

## Brainspotting: A Step-by-Step Process

The magic behind Brainspotting is based on its correlation with your body’s natural healing potential. It functions based on the concept of your visual field, which is somehow connected to regions in your brain where memories, emotions, and sensations are processed. As your brain centers on a specific point in your visual field, your brain starts to process emotions that are not even conscious to you.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Concentrate on a spot**: Your therapist will teach you how to concentrate on a certain spot in your visual field.
2. **Notice the feelings**: You can begin to notice sensations, thoughts, or feelings associated with that point as you focus. It’s like your mind unlocks something that’s been there but unknown to you.
3. **Release the emotions**: As time passes, the focus and emotional work of the process enable the release of those emotions trapped inside your body and mind. It's almost like allowing your brain to reboot itself.

One thing that is great about Brainspotting is that it feels very organic. It doesn’t involve confronting your trauma or challenging yourself to witness your experiences. Rather, it offers you the chance to heal by allowing your brain and body to come into balance.

## Why is Brainspotting Effective?

Brainspotting is effective for a number of reasons, and all of them are science-based. Firstly, Brainspotting targets the subcortical areas of the brain, which are those responsible for the processing of emotional and physical experiences. These are also the areas within which traumas are stored and are unable to communicate effectively with other areas of the brain.

Conventional therapy will usually focus on the cortex, or the thinking part of the mind. However, for individuals who have been subjected to traumas in life, there is a need to address the other parts. Brainspotting techniques can help this process.

In fact, a study carried out by David Grand and other researchers has found that Brainspotting is more helpful for individuals to process traumatic and distressing events than other techniques such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing).

It also utilizes the aspect of plasticity in that it harnesses the brain’s ability to rewire and rebuild itself, basically through what your brain is trying to do, which is altering how your brain processes emotional memories.

## A Personal Story: A Client's Experience

A woman with post-traumatic stress disorder from a car accident experienced relief with Brainspotting, as observed in a study conducted by David Grand in 2016. During her therapy sessions, she was advised to concentrate her attention on a point within her field of vision, linking her to the memory of the car accident.

This was not a quick solution for her. However, after a series of therapy sessions with her new hypnotherapist, she noted that she did not react as much to stimuli related to the accident. In fact, her body even responded because her shoulders were not tense anymore. She even noted changes in her heartbeat.

*"Her experience demonstrates the effective approach that Brainspotting provides for a methodical and safe working through of difficult feelings and trauma without having to relive the details."*

## Real World Research and Scientific Support

There are a couple of articles that describe what Brainspotting is and what research supports the theory:

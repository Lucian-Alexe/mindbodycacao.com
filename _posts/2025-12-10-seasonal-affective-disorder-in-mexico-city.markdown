<div class="intro-blog">As the holiday season approaches, many people prepare for the colder months ahead. However, winter isn’t just a time for cozy sweaters and hot cocoa. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that strikes during the fall and winter, as a result of days being shorter. While you might associate SAD with regions that have long, harsh winters, Mexico City experiences seasonal mood disturbances too. Here’s a closer look at the data behind SAD in Mexico City, and how environmental and seasonal factors influence mental health.</div>



## 1. SAD Symptoms Linked to Reduced Sunlight Exposure

A 2015 study in *Revista de Salud Pública de México* found a significant increase in mood disturbances during the winter months in Mexico City. This study confirmed that reduced sunlight exposure during the fall and winter months led to increased reports of irritability, fatigue, or sleep disturbances.

- **What does the research say**: Around **22% of participants** reported feeling **more tired** and **irritable** during the winter months... which are hallmark symptoms of SAD.

- **Key Insight**: Reduced daylight hours, even in a city with a relatively mild climate, can still trigger symptoms of depression. This supports the notion that SAD is not solely confined to regions with extreme cold or long winters.




## 2. Pollution as a Contributing Factor to Winter Blues

Mexico City is notorious for its **high levels of air pollution**, which can have far-reaching consequences for mental health. A 2013 study published in the *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health* examined the link between **urban stress** (pollution, noise, and crowded living conditions) and seasonal depressive symptoms in Mexico City.

- **What does the research say**: Residents living in areas with the highest levels of air pollution reported increased depressive symptoms during the winter. **34% of participants** from these areas noted feeling **more stressed**, **irritable**, and **fatigued** compared to those living in less polluted neighborhoods.

- **Key Insight**: The combination of **pollution** and **shorter daylight hours** in Mexico City creates a double whammy for those already vulnerable to mood disturbances. Pollution, in particular, seems to exacerbate the effects of reduced sunlight, making the winter months especially difficult for some residents.




## 3. Higher Incidence of Depression-like Symptoms Among Women

A 2011 study in *Salud Mental* specifically examined seasonal mood changes in **Mexican women** living in Mexico City. This study found that women were particularly vulnerable to **SAD-like symptoms**, which became more pronounced during the winter months.

- **What does the research say**: **41% of women** in the study reported feeling **more fatigued** and **sad** during the winter months. This was a significant increase compared to the **26% of men** who reported similar symptoms.

- **Key Insight**: While **Mexico City** doesn’t experience the severe winters seen in other parts of the world, **gender differences** in the response to **seasonal changes** were evident. Women were more likely to report mood disturbances linked to shorter days and limited sunlight.

## What Does This Mean for Mexico City?

Mexico City might not have freezing winters like places in Scandinavia or Canada, but a lot of people still feel down during the colder months. The shorter days, **pollution**, and sometimes feeling a bit lonely can trigger **sadness** and make people feel more tired or irritable.

If you’re feeling this way, there are a few things you can try to help. Get outside when the sun is shining, try **light therapy**, stay active with some exercise, and make sure to hang out with friends or family. If you live in a polluted area, spending time in parks or green spaces can also help reduce stress and boost your mood.

If you're struggling to shake off these feelings, **talking to a therapist** can really help. I offer therapy where we work on practical **coping strategies**, ways to **challenge negative thoughts**, and mindfulness techniques to make it easier to get through the tough days. Reach out if you'd like some support to help make this season a little easier.

<div class="intro-blog">Living abroad is one of the most transformative experiences a person can have. It opens your world, stretches your identity, and invites you into new cultures, relationships, and possibilities. But alongside the excitement, there are moments of loneliness, confusion, grief, and emotional fatigue that are rarely spoken about.</div>

<br>
As someone who has lived in the **United States**, **Europe**, and now **Mexico**, I understand this deeply. I know what it’s like to build a life from scratch, to navigate languages and cultural norms, to miss home, and to redefine who you are in a new environment. Expat life can expand you—but it can also unsettle you. That’s why expat therapy can be so powerful.

When you’re living outside your home country, you need support from someone who understands **both cultures**—the one you came from and the one you're adapting to. Someone who knows, not just conceptually but through lived experience, how complex it can be to hold multiple identities at once.

## Why Expats Seek Therapy

Many expats come to therapy because they’re feeling:

- Disconnected or lonely  
- Emotionally overwhelmed by cultural adjustment  
- Homesick, nostalgic, or ungrounded  
- Confused about identity or belonging  
- Strained in their relationships due to the pressures of relocation  
- Burnt out from constantly adapting  
- Guilty for leaving family behind  
- Excited about change but scared of losing themselves  

These feelings are normal—and they deserve space, understanding, and care.

## A Therapy Approach That Supports the Whole You

My work blends **traditional psychotherapy** with **body-based and integrative approaches**, because expat stress doesn’t only live in the mind—your body holds it, too.

### Talk Therapy for Clarity and Connection  
Together, we explore your emotional landscape, your story, and the parts of yourself that feel stretched thin or uncertain. Therapy becomes a place where all your feelings are valid—and where change begins with gentle awareness.

### Body Movement & Somatic Work  
Expat tension often settles into the body: tight shoulders, shallow breathing, constant alertness.  
Through grounding practices, yoga-inspired movement, and gentle somatic exercises, we help the body release what it has been carrying so you can feel calmer, clearer, and more at home within yourself. These practices are always integrated with talk therapy for a deeper, more complete experience.

### Cacao Ceremonies for Emotional Openness  
For clients who are curious, cacao can be a meaningful way to open the heart, soften emotional barriers, and reconnect with intuition.  
It’s not about ritual for the sake of ritual—it’s about slowing down, listening inwardly, and creating a moment of warmth and connection during a time of transition. Cacao can be done individually or in small groups, and often becomes a grounding complement to regular therapy.

## The Gift of Being Understood

When you’re far from home, you don’t just need a therapist—you need someone who understands the emotional layers of your journey. Someone who knows what it’s like to build a life in a new country, who understands the cultural nuances, and who can support you in navigating both the excitement and the ache.

Expat therapy is not just about coping.  
It’s about growing—rooting—becoming.  

You deserve to feel at home in yourself, wherever you are in the world.

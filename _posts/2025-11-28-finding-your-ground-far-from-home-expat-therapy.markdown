<div class="intro-blog">Living abroad is one of the most transformative experiences a person can have. It opens your world, stretches your identity, and invites you into new cultures, relationships, and possibilities. But alongside the excitement, there are also moments of loneliness, confusion, and emotional fatigue that aren’t always easy to talk about.</div>

<br>

Having lived in the **United States**, **Europe**, and now **Mexico**, I understand this on a personal level. I know what it’s like to rebuild a life from scratch, navigate new languages and cultural norms, miss home, and rediscover pieces of yourself in unfamiliar places. Life abroad expands you, but it can also unground you.  
That’s where therapy can offer real support.

Sometimes you simply need someone who understands what it feels like to hold more than one culture, identity, or version of yourself at once. Someone who knows how complex it can be to create a sense of home when everything around you is new.

## Why People Seek Therapy While Living Abroad

Many people reach out because they’re feeling:

- Disconnected or lonely  
- Emotionally overwhelmed by adjusting to a new environment  
- Homesick, nostalgic, or unsteady  
- Unsure of where they belong  
- Strained in relationships due to major life changes  
- Burnt out from constantly adapting  
- Guilty for being far from family  
- Excited for new beginnings but afraid of losing themselves  

These feelings are real, valid, and deserving of care.

## A Therapy Approach That Supports the Whole You

My work blends **traditional psychotherapy** with **body-based and integrative approaches**, because stress from major transitions doesn’t live only in the mind—your body holds it, too.

### Talk Therapy for Clarity and Connection  
We explore your emotions, your story, and the parts of your identity that feel stretched or uncertain. Therapy becomes a grounded space where your experiences make sense, where you feel supported, and where change begins with gentle awareness.

### Body Movement & Somatic Work  
Stress from cultural and life transitions often settles into the body: tight shoulders, restless energy, shallow breathing.  
Through grounding practices, yoga-inspired movement, and somatic exercises, we help your body release what it has been holding so you can feel calmer and more centered. These practices are always integrated with talk therapy for deeper impact.

### Cacao Ceremonies for Emotional Openness  
For clients who are curious, cacao can offer a warm, grounding way to open the heart, soften emotional tension, and reconnect with intuition.  
It isn’t about performing a ceremony—it’s about creating a gentle, meaningful moment of presence during times of change. Cacao can be experienced individually or in small groups and often becomes a supportive complement to ongoing therapy.

## The Gift of Being Understood

When you’re far from familiarity, you don’t just need a therapist—you need someone who understands the emotional layers of your journey. Someone who knows what it feels like to start over, to adapt, to grow in unfamiliar soil.

Therapy in these moments isn’t only about coping.  
It’s about rooting, integrating, and becoming.

You deserve to feel grounded and at home within yourself, no matter where life takes you.

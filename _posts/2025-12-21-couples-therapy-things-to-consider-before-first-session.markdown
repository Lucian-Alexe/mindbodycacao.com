<div class="intro-blog">Relationships are really important to us. They help us when we need it; they are people we can talk to. They make us feel like we are part of something. Sometimes relationships can be confusing; they can make us feel frustrated, and we can feel really far away from each other when we do not talk about what is wrong. Couple therapy is there to help people in a relationship understand each other better, talk to each other better, and feel close again. One thing to keep in mind is that relationships matter and couple therapy can help with that. You do not have to wait until relationships are really struggling to get help. Actually, if you get help early, it is easier to make things better in your relationships.</div>

## 5 Things to Do to Prepare for a Successful Couple Therapy

### 1. Figure out why you are going on this trip and what you want to get out of it both on your own and, with the people you are traveling with.

Before you go to your couple therapy session think about why you want to do this. What is bothering you now? What is not feeling right in your relationship? Do you feel like you are not connecting or that you keep having the arguments over and over again? Maybe there are things that you have not been able to work out.

Each person in the couple may have their reasons for wanting to go to therapy and that is totally fine. You do not have to see things the same way. Couple therapy's a place where you can talk about your differences without feeling scared or worried. If you have some idea of what you want to work on it will make your sessions more useful and meaningful, from the beginning. Couple therapy is a place to explore these things and work on your relationship and your couple therapy sessions will be more focused if you think about these things beforehand.

### 2. Go In with an Open Mind (Not a Goal to “Win”)

Couple therapy is not about figuring out who is right and who is wrong. It is about understanding the patterns that you and your partner follow the emotions that you both feel and the needs that are not being met. You should try to let go of the idea that the therapist will pick a side.

Instead you should think of couple therapy as a place where you and your partner can both talk about how you feel and get support. The more you are willing to listen and learn the more couple therapy will help you and your partner. Couple therapy is really, about understanding couple patterns and couple emotions and helping you to meet each others needs.

When your partner talks about how they feel you should try not to jump right away and explain or fix things or defend yourself.

Just remember that listening to your partner does not mean you have to agree with them it just means you are trying to understand where the other person is coming from. The therapy can help couples, like you and your partner to talk to each other in a way and this can make a big difference. Listening to your partner is a part of therapy and it can really help you and your partner to communicate better.

### 4. Reflect on Patterns, Not Just Problems

When you are in a relationship you should think about the patterns that happen over and over. Do you and your partner always argue about the things? What do you do when you have a fight? Do you stop talking get upset or try to avoid talking about it? If you can see what you do it can really help you make changes that last. It is an idea to write down some notes before you go to therapy. This helps you get your thoughts together and figure out what you want to talk about. Writing down your thoughts, about your relationship patterns can make your therapy sessions more helpful.

### 5. Be Willing to Do the Work Between Sessions

Couple therapy does not stop when you leave the therapists office. The real difference happens when you are at home in your life and it is about how you talk to each other how you deal with problems and how you show you care about the couple. Your therapist might give you some things to try, like thinking about your actions or making changes to work on between the times you see them. If you go into therapy thinking that you will really try to use what you learn it will make the whole thing work a lot better for the couple. You will feel good, about it.

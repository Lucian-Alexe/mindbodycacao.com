                <p class="page-intro">Psychotherapy offers a supportive, evidence-based space to understand your emotions, process difficult experiences, and move toward lasting wellbeing. Whether you’re dealing with anxiety, trauma, depression, relationship challenges, or major life transitions, therapy can help you gain clarity, resilience, and a deeper sense of self.</p>
                <p>Sessions are available online or in-person in Mexico City, in English or Spanish.</p>
                <p>Psychotherapy can help anyone who feels overwhelmed, confused, or weighed down by life. Many people seek support when anxiety begins to interfere with daily routines, when emotions feel too heavy to carry alone, or when they notice they are repeating patterns that no longer serve them. Others come to therapy during moments of change, such as moving to a new city, ending a relationship, starting something new, or trying to understand who they are becoming.</p>
                <p>For people experiencing depression, therapy offers a space to explore feelings of sadness, numbness, or disconnection in a gentle and caring way. Those healing from trauma often find comfort in having a safe place where their experiences are understood and where healing can unfold at a pace that feels right. Therapy is also helpful during times of grief, whether someone has passed away or life has taken a turn that feels difficult to accept.</p>
                <p>Adolescents benefit from having a supportive space to make sense of big emotions and pressures. Expats in Mexico City or Mexicans living abroad often appreciate having someone who understands the complexities of living between cultures and the mix of excitement, loneliness, and adjustment that comes with it.</p>
                <p>No matter the reason, therapy offers a place to feel heard, understood, and supported while you work toward greater clarity, balance, and emotional wellbeing.</p>

                                <h3>Traditional Psychotherapy</h3>
                                <p>A space to talk, reflect, and be genuinely heard. Together, we explore your emotions, patterns, and experiences at a pace that feels safe.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> You gain clarity about what you’re feeling and why. Many clients describe feeling lighter, more grounded, and more in control of their reactions. Over time, old patterns become easier to understand—and easier to change.</p>
                            </li>

                                <h3>Brainspotting Therapy</h3>
                                <p>A powerful mind–body therapy that works through eye positions to access deeper emotional layers that words sometimes can’t reach.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> Clients frequently say Brainspotting feels like “unlocking” a feeling they couldn’t name. It helps release tension stored in the body, brings emotional clarity, and supports healing from trauma, stress, and overwhelm.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Person-Centered Therapy</h3>
                                <p>A warm, respectful approach where your experiences guide the process. You’re met with empathy, honesty, and a deep belief in your capacity to grow.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> Patients often share that this feels like the first place where they can be fully themselves. It builds confidence, strengthens intuition, and supports meaningful emotional growth—especially for adolescents or those feeling misunderstood.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Trauma-Informed Therapy</h3>
                                <p>A gentle approach that honors how trauma affects the brain, body, and sense of safety. Nothing is rushed; everything is guided by what feels right for you.</p>

                                <h3>Cross-Cultural Adjustment Therapy</h3>
                                <p>Therapy designed for expats, migrants, and anyone living between cultures.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> Patients often say they finally feel understood, without needing to explain the invisible challenges of being far from home. Sessions help you navigate loneliness, identity shifts, relationship stress, and the emotional fatigue of constant adaptation.</p>

                            <li>
                                <h3>Grief & Loss Support</h3>
                                <p>A compassionate space to navigate loss in all its forms: death, breakups, major life transitions, or endings that feel hard to name.</p>
                                <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> People describe this work as having “someone to hold the weight with me.” Together, we honor your loss, make space for your emotions, and help you rebuild a sense of meaning and connection, one step at a time.</p>

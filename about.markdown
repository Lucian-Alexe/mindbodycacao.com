    <p class="page-intro">Trusting your mental, emotional, or spiritual wellbeing to someone new is no small thing. I get it because I’ve been on the other side of the therapy room myself. Degrees and certifications matter, but connection matters more. That’s why I offer <a href="https://zcal.co/mindbodycacao/consultation" target="_blank">a free 15-minute consultation</a> so we can see if we genuinely click, with no pressure and no expectations.</p>
    <p>If you’re curious about my background, here’s a little more:</p>
    <p>I’ve been a therapist for over 10 years, working with a wide range of challenges, including anxiety, depression, trauma, addictions, relationship struggles, major life transitions, and that feeling of being stuck without knowing why. Over time, I’ve learned that therapy is not one-size-fits-all. Talk therapy is powerful, but sometimes the mind needs more than conversation alone. Techniques like <strong>EMDR</strong> or <strong>Brainspotting</strong> can help process trauma or difficult experiences in ways words cannot always reach.</p>
    <p>Before therapy, <strong>movement was my first language</strong>. I spent more than a decade as a dancer, which taught me something essential: the body remembers, expresses, and releases in ways the mind often cannot. That insight eventually led me to train as a certified yoga instructor and to integrate embodiment practices into my therapeutic work. Sometimes a blended approach involving mind, body, and emotion is exactly what opens the door to healing.</p>
    <p>My international experience also shapes the way I work. I practiced as a <strong>psychotherapist in the Chicago area</strong> for over three years, and many of the clients I supported there continue with me today. Straddling cultures is part of my story, and it has helped me understand what it feels like to relocate, adjust, rebuild a support network, and redefine the idea of home.</p>
    <p>Here in Mexico, I have also reconnected with ancestral traditions, including cacao. Cacao ceremonies have been used in Mesoamerican cultures for grounding, emotional opening, and connection. While not every client needs cacao work, it can be a supportive tool in moments when the heart needs a more ritualized and embodied way to soften and release.</p>
    <p>If you’re interested in working together, I would love to meet you.</p>
